# Privacy Policy

Effective date: July 14, 2025

Healthy Rhythm (“the app”) is developed and maintained by Johan Karlsson. This app is designed to support well-being and daily routines by allowing users to track activities and view their progress. This privacy policy outlines how your data is handled.

## 1. Data Collection

Healthy Rhythm does not collect any personally identifiable information. All data is stored locally on your device unless you explicitly choose to sync data with Apple Health.

### Health Data

If you enable HealthKit access, the app may read data from Apple Health related to:

- Water intake

This information is only used to help automatically mark activities as complete and is never stored externally or shared.

## 2. Data Storage

All app data remains on your device. Healthy Rhythm does not transmit or store any data on external servers or cloud services.

## 3. Analytics

The app does not use any third-party analytics services. Your behavior in the app is not tracked or analyzed beyond what is stored on your device.

## 4. Permissions

To function properly, the app may request the following permissions:

- **Health Access** (optional): To read selected health data from Apple Health if you choose to enable syncing.
- **Notification Access** (optional): If reminders or notifications are introduced in the future.

These permissions are optional and are not required to use the core features of the app.
