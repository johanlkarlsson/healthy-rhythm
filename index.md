# Privacy Policy for Healthy Rhythm

Effective date: Friday 20th June 2025

Healthy Rhythm is a wellness app designed to help you reflect on your daily habits. Your privacy is important, and this policy outlines what information we do — and more importantly, **do not** — collect.

## What We Collect

We **do not collect any personal information.**

The app works entirely offline and stores all data locally on your device.

## What We Don't Do

- We do **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal data
- We do **not** use analytics or tracking technologies
- We do **not** require account creation or login
- We do **not** access HealthKit, location, contacts, or any other sensitive data

## Optional Features

If you opt into beta testing via TestFlight, Apple may collect crash reports or usage information in accordance with [Apple’s Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/). This data is not visible to us.

## Future Updates

Should the app offer online features in the future, such as cloud sync or competitions, we will update this policy to reflect any changes and ask for your permission where appropriate.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this policy, feel free to contact the developer:
